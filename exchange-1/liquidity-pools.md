# Liquidity Pools

\*\*\*\*[**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/) allows you to be a liquidity provider by adding your tokens to liquidity pools. Each pool represents one traiding pair and can be described by two token ids and the amount of tokens in the pool.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool, you will receive LP tokens \(liquidity provider tokens\).

For example, if you deposit **$ENX** and $ENQ into a liquidity pool, you will receive ENX-ENQ LP tokens.

The number of LP tokens you own shows your share of the ENX-ENQ liquidity pool. You can always take your funds back by sending your LP tokens in exchange on **$ENX** and $ENQ. But proportion of $ENX and $ENQ may vary based on the price change in the ENX-ENQ pool. It is the risk Liquidity Provider takes in exchange of the pool fees.

**Add liquidity**

You provide tokens to the liquidity pool in a current pool's ratio. As an example, given 1:10 ENX-ENQ ratio in the pool you should add simultaniusly **20 $ENX and 200 $ENQ** liquidity \($$\frac{20}{200} = \frac{1}{10}$$ \).

To make liquidity provider role even more appealing you can put your LP tokens to work for you at [**Space Harvest Farms**](../yield-farming-space-harvest-farm.md), while still earning trading fee reward, after ENEX V. 1.1 will be launched.   

Liquidity providers can also create a pair LP to $ENX and then stake $ENX at [**Space Station** ](../space-station-pool.md) and get rewards in $ENX from [**each trade**](../treasury-fund/treasury-fund.md) from pair of LP tokens.

**Liquidity providers fee**

**0.30%** - from each trade will be returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**Create a pool**

If the pool you wish to provide liquidity to does not exist, you can create it by yourself with the same procedure as adding liquidity. As the first liquidity provider, you set the initial exchange ratio \(price\). This often quickly corrects itself through arbitrage and by more liquidity providers adding to the pool.

**A2A**

At [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/) you can create a liquidity pool with any token, issued over Enecuum Network and any tokens â€” any to any \(A2A\).
