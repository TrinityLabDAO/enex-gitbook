# Treasury Fund

### **How Treasury Fund arise?** 

Treasury Fund consists of two main parts: 

* **LP tokens** 
* **$ENX**

LP tokens at the rate of **0,05%** added to TF every time when users [make a trade](commission-structure.md) on [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/) ****

**$ENX** will be added to TF at the time it will be[ issued](../tokenomics.md) based on the [tokenomics ](../tokenomics.md)rules.

### **How Treasury Fund is regulated?**

**LP Tokens.**

LP tokens proposed to be converted to **$ENX** and rewarded to **$ENX** stakers at [**Space Station**](../space-station-pool.md) daily based. 

This motivation program is executed automatically with **one required condition** - the pair of **$ENX** and this relative LP token have to be staked to [**Space Harvest Farm.**](../yield-farming-space-harvest-farm.md)\*\*\*\*

If this required condition not performed - those LP tokens **will be burned** by **Commander ENEX** daily based, which will guarantee availability of liquidity in this trading pair in equivalent of burned.

**$ENX.** 

**$ENX** tokens propose to be reward as motivation to provide a liquidity to pools and stake LP/ENX pair at [**Space Harvest Farm.**](../yield-farming-space-harvest-farm.md)\*\*\*\*

The size and timing of rewards incentive programs will be regulated by governance of **$ENX** holders after **Commander ENEX** will transfer his operation of **$ENX** Treasury Fund to community.
