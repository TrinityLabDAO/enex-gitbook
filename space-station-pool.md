# Space Station

When users make trades on the [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/)  a **0.35%** fee is[ charged](treasury-fund/commission-structure.md).

**0.05%** of this fee is added to the **Space Station** in the form of LP tokens for the relative pool.

When the rewards contract is called \(minimum once per day\) all the LP tokens are sold for **$ENX** \(on [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/)\). The newly purchased **$ENX** is then divided up proportionally between the **$ENX** stakers in the **Space Station**.

Stake your **$ENX** to get **0,05%** fees from each trades on [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/)\*\*\*\*
