# Space Drop

 ðŸ˜‡ **Space Drop is a place where Enecuum Network projects can be introduced to the community**

Space Drop allow [Enecuum Network](https://pulse.enecuum.com/) projects to achieve high user adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to **$ENX** token holders.

Space Drop are presented in two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the **Commander ENEX**.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project are able to distribute tokens, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/) interface as a default option.
